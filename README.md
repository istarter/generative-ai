# Guidelines for Prompting
In this lesson, you'll practice two prompting principles and their related tactics in order to write effective prompts for large language models.

## Setup
#### Load the API key and relevant Python libaries.

In this course, we've provided some code that loads the OpenAI API key for you.


```python
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

#### helper function
Throughout this course, we will use OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model and the [chat completions endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat). 

This helper function will make it easier to use prompts and look at the generated outputs.  
**Note**: In June 2023, OpenAI updated gpt-3.5-turbo. The results you see in the notebook may be slightly different than those in the video. Some of the prompts have also been slightly modified to product the desired results.


```python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

**Note:** This and all other lab notebooks of this course use OpenAI library version `0.27.0`. 

In order to use the OpenAI library version `1.0.0`, here is the code that you would use instead for the `get_completion` function:

```python
client = openai.OpenAI()

def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

## Prompting Principles
- **Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions**
- **Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”**

### Tactics

#### Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
- Delimiters can be anything like: ```, """, < >, `<tag> </tag>`, `:`


```python
text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by \ 
providing instructions that are as clear and \ 
specific as you can possibly make them. \ 
This will guide the model towards the desired output, \ 
and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \ 
or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \ 
clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \ 
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \ 
and context for the model, which can lead to \ 
more detailed and relevant outputs.
"""
prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \ 
into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

#### Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output
- JSON, HTML


```python
prompt = f"""
Generate a list of three made-up book titles along \ 
with their authors and genres. 
Provide them in JSON format with the following keys: 
book_id, title, author, genre.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

#### Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied


```python
text_1 = f"""
Making a cup of tea is easy! First, you need to get some \ 
water boiling. While that's happening, \ 
grab a cup and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is \ 
hot enough, just pour it over the tea bag. \ 
Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep. After a \ 
few minutes, take out the tea bag. If you \ 
like, you can add some sugar or milk to taste. \ 
And that's it! You've got yourself a delicious \ 
cup of tea to enjoy.
"""
prompt = f"""
You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes. 
If it contains a sequence of instructions, \ 
re-write those instructions in the following format:

Step 1 - ...
Step 2 - …
…
Step N - …

If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, \ 
then simply write \"No steps provided.\"

\"\"\"{text_1}\"\"\"
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print("Completion for Text 1:")
print(response)
```


```python
text_2 = f"""
The sun is shining brightly today, and the birds are \
singing. It's a beautiful day to go for a \ 
walk in the park. The flowers are blooming, and the \ 
trees are swaying gently in the breeze. People \ 
are out and about, enjoying the lovely weather. \ 
Some are having picnics, while others are playing \ 
games or simply relaxing on the grass. It's a \ 
perfect day to spend time outdoors and appreciate the \ 
beauty of nature.
"""
prompt = f"""
You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes. 
If it contains a sequence of instructions, \ 
re-write those instructions in the following format:

Step 1 - ...
Step 2 - …
…
Step N - …

If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, \ 
then simply write \"No steps provided.\"

\"\"\"{text_2}\"\"\"
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print("Completion for Text 2:")
print(response)
```

#### Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting


```python
prompt = f"""
Your task is to answer in a consistent style.

<child>: Teach me about patience.

<grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest \ 
valley flows from a modest spring; the \ 
grandest symphony originates from a single note; \ 
the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.

<child>: Teach me about resilience.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

### Principle 2: Give the model time to “think” 

#### Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task


```python
text = f"""
In a charming village, siblings Jack and Jill set out on \ 
a quest to fetch water from a hilltop \ 
well. As they climbed, singing joyfully, misfortune \ 
struck—Jack tripped on a stone and tumbled \ 
down the hill, with Jill following suit. \ 
Though slightly battered, the pair returned home to \ 
comforting embraces. Despite the mishap, \ 
their adventurous spirits remained undimmed, and they \ 
continued exploring with delight.
"""
# example 1
prompt_1 = f"""
Perform the following actions: 
1 - Summarize the following text delimited by triple \
backticks with 1 sentence.
2 - Translate the summary into French.
3 - List each name in the French summary.
4 - Output a json object that contains the following \
keys: french_summary, num_names.

Separate your answers with line breaks.

Text:
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt_1)
print("Completion for prompt 1:")
print(response)
```

#### Ask for output in a specified format


```python
prompt_2 = f"""
Your task is to perform the following actions: 
1 - Summarize the following text delimited by 
  <> with 1 sentence.
2 - Translate the summary into French.
3 - List each name in the French summary.
4 - Output a json object that contains the 
  following keys: french_summary, num_names.

Use the following format:
Text: <text to summarize>
Summary: <summary>
Translation: <summary translation>
Names: <list of names in summary>
Output JSON: <json with summary and num_names>

Text: <{text}>
"""
response = get_completion(prompt_2)
print("\nCompletion for prompt 2:")
print(response)
```

#### Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion


```python
prompt = f"""
Determine if the student's solution is correct or not.

Question:
I'm building a solar power installation and I need \
 help working out the financials. 
- Land costs $100 / square foot
- I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
- I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost \ 
me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square \
foot
What is the total cost for the first year of operations 
as a function of the number of square feet.

Student's Solution:
Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
Costs:
1. Land cost: 100x
2. Solar panel cost: 250x
3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

#### Note that the student's solution is actually not correct.
#### We can fix this by instructing the model to work out its own solution first.


```python
prompt = f"""
Your task is to determine if the student's solution \
is correct or not.
To solve the problem do the following:
- First, work out your own solution to the problem including the final total. 
- Then compare your solution to the student's solution \ 
and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. 
Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until 
you have done the problem yourself.

Use the following format:
Question:
```

```
Student's solution:
```

Actual solution:
```

## Model Limitations: Hallucinations
- Boie is a real company, the product name is not real.


```python
prompt = f"""

#### Notes on using the OpenAI API outside of this classroom

To install the OpenAI Python library:
```
!pip install openai
```

The library needs to be configured with your account's secret key, which is available on the [website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). 

You can either set it as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before using the library:
 ```
 !export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
 ```

Or, set `openai.api_key` to its value:

```
import openai
openai.api_key = "sk-..."
```

#### A note about the backslash
- In the course, we are using a backslash `\` to make the text fit on the screen without inserting newline '\n' characters.
- GPT-3 isn't really affected whether you insert newline characters or not.  But when working with LLMs in general, you may consider whether newline characters in your prompt may affect the model's performance.


```python

```

# Iterative Prompt Development
In this lesson, you'll iteratively analyze and refine your prompts to generate marketing copy from a product fact sheet.

## Setup


```python
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```


```python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

**Note**: In June 2023, OpenAI updated gpt-3.5-turbo. The results you see in the notebook may be slightly different than those in the video. Some of the prompts have also been slightly modified to product the desired results.

3 weeks all on the same charge. But the toothbrush head \
is too small. I’ve seen baby toothbrushes bigger than \

length bristles to get between teeth better because \
this one doesn’t.  Overall if you can get this one \
around the $50 mark, it's a good deal. The manufactuer's \
replacements heads are pretty expensive, but you can \
get generic ones that're more reasonably priced. This \
toothbrush makes me feel like I've been to the dentist \

up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \
system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \
So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good \
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \ 
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \ 
spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \
sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \ 
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \
much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
I called customer service but the warranty expired \

## Inferring topics


```python

In a recent survey conducted by the government, 
public sector employees were asked to rate their level 
of satisfaction with the department they work at. 
The results revealed that NASA was the most popular 
department with a satisfaction rating of 95%.

One NASA employee, John Smith, commented on the findings, 
stating, "I'm not surprised that NASA came out on top. 
It's a great place to work with amazing people and 
incredible opportunities. I'm proud to be a part of 
such an innovative organization."

The results were also welcomed by NASA's management team, 
with Director Tom Johnson stating, "We are thrilled to 
hear that our employees are satisfied with their work at NASA. 
We have a talented and dedicated team who work tirelessly 
to achieve our goals, and it's fantastic to see that their 
hard work is paying off."

The survey also revealed that the 
Social Security Administration had the lowest satisfaction 
rating, with only 45% of employees indicating they were 
satisfied with their job. The government has pledged to 
address the concerns raised by employees in the survey and 
work towards improving job satisfaction across all departments.
